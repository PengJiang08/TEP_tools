TEP_tools
====


# Overview
TEP_tools is the python scripts to evalulate thermoelectric properties by using transmittance data calculated by OpenMX code.


* eltran.py is a script to obtain the averaged transmittance in the first Brillouin zone.

* eltep.py is a script to calculate electric conductance, Seebeck coefficient, power factor, and electron thermal conductance buy using transmittance.

* ZT.py is a script to calculate thermoelectric figure of merit. If you have the data of phonon thermal conductance depends on temperature, this script is available.
